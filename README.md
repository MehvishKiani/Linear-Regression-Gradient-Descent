# Linear-Regression-Gradient-Descent
Explore the fundamentals of Linear Regression optimization with this lightweight Python repository. The code employs Gradient Descent to iteratively adjust parameters for an optimal fit to sample data. A concise setup makes it an ideal starting point for those delving into regression modeling.
. The code, written in Python with NumPy and Matplotlib, includes:

Initialization of parameters (intercept and slope).
Sample data for independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.
Hyperparameters setting (learning rate and iterations).
Cost function calculation using Mean Squared Error.
Gradient Descent to update parameters and minimize the cost.
Visualization of the data points, best-fit line, and the Gradient Descent path.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linear-Regression-Gradient-Descent.git
Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to observe the Linear Regression process.

Sample Data
The provided sample data includes:

Independent variable (X): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Dependent variable (y): [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]
Hyperparameters
Adjust the learning rate and number of iterations as needed in the script.
